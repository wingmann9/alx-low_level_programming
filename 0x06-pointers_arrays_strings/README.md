A snippet of each file funtions is given below:

- main.h: Header file containing all the functions prototype in the directory.
- 0-strcat.c: concatenates two strings.
- 1-strncat.c: concatenates two strings using at most an inputted number of bytes.
- 2-strncpy.c: copies a string.
- 3-strcmp.c: compares two strings.
- 4-rev_array.c: reverses the content of an array of integers.
- 5-string_toupper.c: changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- 6-cap_string.c: capitalizes all words of a string.
- 7-leet.c: encodes a string into "1337", without "switch" or ternary operations and using only one "if" and two loops.
- 100-rot13.c: encodes a string to "rot13", without "switch" or ternary operations and using only one "if" and two loops.
- 101-print_number.c: prints an integer without using long, arrays, pointers, or hard-coded special values.
- 102-magic.c: prints "a[2] = 98" using pointer magic.
- 103-infinite_add.c: adds two numbers stored in strings to a buffer.
- 104-print_buffer.c: prints the content of an inputted number of bytes from a buffer
