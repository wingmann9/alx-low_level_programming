This directory is all about memory allocation in C.
The difference between automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free and how, why and when to use them.
It also give insight to the usage and function of valgrind.
A snippet of each file function in the directory is given below:

- 0-create_array.c: creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
- 1-strdup.c: returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
- 2-str_concat.c: concatenates two strings.
- 3-alloc_grid.c: returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
- 4-free_grid.c: frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.
- 100-argstostr.c: concatenates all the arguments of your program.
- 101-strtow.c: splits a string into words.
- main.h: Header file containing all the header and function prototypes used in this directory.
