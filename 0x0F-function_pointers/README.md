- 1-array_iterator.c: C function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- 2-int_index.c: C function that searches for an integer.
- 3-main.c: C program that performs simple mathematical operations.
- 3-op_functions.c: C file containing 5 functions.
- 3-get_op_func.c: C function that selects the correct function from
  3-op_functions.c to perform the operation asked by the user.
- 3-calc.h: Header file containing the definition and function prototype for 3-main.c.
- 100-main_opcodes.c: C program that prints the opcodes of its own main function, followed by a new line.
