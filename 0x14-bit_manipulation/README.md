- 1-print_binary.c: C function that prints the binary representation of a number.
- 2-get_bit.c: C function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
- 3-set_bit.c: C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 1.
- 4-clear_bit.c: C function that sets the value of a bit at a given index to 0.
- 5-flip_bits.c: C function that returns the number of bits needed to be flipped to get from one number to another.
- 100-get_endianness.c: C function that checks the endianness.
- 101-password: File containing the password for the crackme3 executable.
- main.h: Header file containing prototypes for all functions written in the directory.
