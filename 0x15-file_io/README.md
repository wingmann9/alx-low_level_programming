In this directory, I learned about the three standard file descriptors and their POSIX names as well as the difference between function and system calls. I practiced using the I/O system calls open, close, read, and write and the flags O_RDONLY, WR_ONLY, and O_RDWR to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C.
The function of each file is given below:

- 0-read_textfile.c: C function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.
- 1-create_file.c: C function that creates a file.
- 2-append_text_to_file.c: C function that appends text at the end of a file.
- 3-cp.c: C program that copies the contents of a file to another file.
- 100-elf_header.c: C program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
- main.h: Header file containing all functions prototype in the directory.
